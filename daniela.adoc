=== Technical writer's fails [Daniela]
When a reader has a problem, he needs to solve it immediately. He needs to find a clear and exact solution quickly and not be confused due to *ambiguous and complicated explanation*. If a technical writer does not observe the rules, a reader needs *not understand* and has to spend time by *asking for a hint* another way (if he knows which one).
