== Technical writer's job [Michal]
A *technical writer* describes programs, their functions, features, changes among versions, etc. He understands programs and knows that everyone needs them for different purposes. He has abilities to gather information from many scattered sources, assimilate and convey them. Used definitions are clear, accurate, condensed and written in a technical language (_see below_). Therefore, the technical writer is not a writer.
