== What is technical English? [Mark√©ta]
*Technical English* is English used in documentations where language has to be accurate and can't be misunderstood. Typically, you can't use _metaphors_, you should _avoid long hard-to-read sentences_ and     also _relative clauses_ because they could be easily misread.
