=== Understanding the audience [David]
Every text has its audience and so do _change logs_, _release notes_ and such. Writers therefore should follow the rules and recommendations for the text they're writing. For technical writers this is to write a text that does not contain metaphors, idioms and text figures that might not be clear some people. *Technical text* therefore *should be simply written, descriptional and very exact*.
