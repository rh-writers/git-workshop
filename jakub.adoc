=== Why is technical English used in technical documents

*Why?* That is almost the same question like 'Why is water in soup?' ;-) It is a must! Soup without water is not a soup. And the same work for technical English and technical document. Let's stop joking. Sorry.

*Technical English* is being used to avoid misinterpretations from readers. To be _clear_, _accurate_ and always _well understood_. Understanding technical documentation is necessary bacause instructions and    descriptions are given about how technical software is used and managed. There is `no place for misunderstandings`.
