=== Why is technical English used in technical documents?

*Technical English* is being used to avoid misinterpretations than can occur when normal English is used. To be _clear_, _accurate_ and  _brief_ is vital.

Understanding technical documentation is necessary because instructions and descriptions are given about how technical software is used and managed. There is `no place for misunderstandings` due to potential expensive problems when one did not understand well.
